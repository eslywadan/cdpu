# Asymmetric crptography

## Fundamentals of Asymmetric Crypto: 
### Briefly explain the core idea: 
two keys (public and private) mathematically linked.
### Standard Use Cases vs. the Question: 
Clarify that typically we use the public key for encryption (to ensure only the holder of the private key can decrypt) and the private key for signing (to authenticate origin and integrity).
### Why the Question's Formulation is Misleading: 
The question assumes public key decrypts and private key encrypts in a general sense. This is not entirely accurate. It's about operations that are enabled by these keys.
### Correct Operations with Public and Private Keys:
- ***Encryption with Public Key: Data encrypted with the public key*** can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key. This ensures confidentiality.
### Digital Signatures with Private Key: 
***Data signed with the private key can be verified by anyone possessing the corresponding public key.*** This ensures authenticity and non-repudiation.
Why the Confusion Arises: The terms "encryption" and "decryption" are sometimes used loosely. It's more accurate to think of operations: "encrypt for confidentiality" and "sign for authentication."
### Illustrative Analogy (Lockbox): 
Use a lockbox analogy to make it easier to understand the different operations and key roles.
### Key Point: 
Emphasize that the mathematical relationship between the keys is what allows these operations, not simply that one key "encrypts" and the other "decrypts" in all contexts.

It seems there's a slight misunderstanding in your question.  In standard asymmetric cryptography (like RSA), it's actually not the case that you use the public key to decrypt and the private key to encrypt for achieving confidentiality (keeping secrets). It's the other way around, or more precisely, they are used for different purposes:

Let's clarify the operations and roles of public and private keys in asymmetric cryptography, especially using RSA as an example:

## Asymmetric Cryptography: Two Keys, Two Operations

The fundamental concept of asymmetric cryptography (also known as public-key cryptography) is the use of two mathematically related keys for each entity:

### Public Key:

This key is meant to be publicly known and distributed. Think of it as your publicly advertised "mailbox address."
Operation: The public key is primarily used for two main operations:
Encryption: To encrypt data intended for you. Anyone can use your public key to encrypt a message.
Verification of Digital Signatures: To verify digital signatures that were created using your corresponding private key.

### Private Key:

This key is kept secret and should be known only to its owner. Think of it as the key to your mailbox.
Operation: The private key is also used for two main operations:
Decryption: To decrypt data that was encrypted using your public key. Only you, as the holder of the private key, can decrypt messages encrypted with your public key.
Creating Digital Signatures: To digitally sign data, proving that it originated from you and hasn't been tampered with.
Let's address the common confusion point directly:

Why is it NOT Public Key Decryption and Private Key Encryption for Confidentiality?

If you used the public key to decrypt and the private key to encrypt for the purpose of keeping messages secret, it would not achieve confidentiality. Here's why:

If you encrypted with your Private Key, anyone with your Public Key could decrypt it. Remember, the public key is public. If you encrypt a message with your private key, anyone in the world who has your public key (which is supposed to be everyone) could decrypt it. This would provide no secrecy.
If you decrypted with the Public Key, anyone could decrypt messages intended for you. Again, your public key is public. If decryption was done with the public key, anyone could decrypt any message.
The Correct Usage for Confidentiality and Authentication:

1. Encryption for Confidentiality (Keeping Messages Secret):

Scenario: Alice wants to send a secret message to Bob.

Process:

Alice gets Bob's Public Key (Bob makes this public and widely available).
Alice encrypts her message using Bob's Public Key.
Alice sends the encrypted message to Bob.
Only Bob can decrypt the message because only Bob possesses the corresponding Private Key to his public key.
Bob uses his Private Key to decrypt the message sent by Alice.
Key Idea for Confidentiality:  Encrypt with the recipient's Public Key. Decrypt with the recipient's Private Key. This ensures only the intended recipient (who holds the private key) can read the message.

2. Digital Signatures for Authentication and Non-Repudiation (Proving Origin and Integrity):

Scenario: Bob wants to send a message to Alice, and Bob wants to prove to Alice (and anyone else) that the message genuinely came from him and hasn't been altered.

Process:

Bob signs his message using his Private Key. This process creates a digital signature that is uniquely linked to the message and Bob's private key.
Bob sends both the message and the digital signature to Alice.
Alice (or anyone) can verify the digital signature using Bob's Public Key.
If the signature verification is successful, Alice is assured:
Authentication: The message truly originated from Bob (because only Bob should have access to his private key).
Integrity: The message has not been tampered with since it was signed (because any alteration would invalidate the signature).
Non-Repudiation: Bob cannot later deny sending the message (because his private key was used to sign it).
Key Idea for Digital Signatures: Sign with the sender's Private Key. Verify with the sender's Public Key. This ensures authenticity and integrity of the message and verifies the sender's identity.

Analogy: The Lockbox and Keys

Imagine a special lockbox with two keys: a public key and a private key.

Public Key (The Lock):

You can give copies of this public key to anyone.
Operation 1: Encryption (Putting a message in the lockbox): Anyone with the public key can use it to lock the lockbox, placing a message inside. Once locked with the public key, only the private key can unlock it.
Operation 2: Signature Verification (Checking if the lockbox was sealed by the owner): The lock itself (public key mechanism) can be used to verify a seal (digital signature) placed by the private key owner. If the seal is valid, it proves the owner locked it.
Private Key (The Unlock Key and Seal Maker):

You keep this key secret and only you have it.
Operation 1: Decryption (Opening the lockbox): Only the private key can unlock a lockbox that was locked with the corresponding public key. This allows you to retrieve messages meant only for you.
Operation 2: Digital Signature Creation (Creating a seal for the lockbox): You can use the private key to create a unique seal (digital signature) and attach it to a message or put it on the lockbox. This seal can be verified using the public key by anyone to prove it came from you.
In summary:

Public Key for Encryption (Confidentiality): Think of it as "locking" a message for the recipient to "unlock" with their private key.
Private Key for Digital Signatures (Authentication and Integrity): Think of it as "signing" or "sealing" a message to prove it's from you, and anyone can "verify" the seal using your public key.
The confusion often arises from the terms "encryption" and "decryption" being used loosely. It's more accurate to think in terms of the operations each key enables and the security goals they achieve: confidentiality (encryption with public key) and authentication/integrity (signatures with private key).  The mathematics of algorithms like RSA are designed to make these operations possible with the unique relationship between the public and private key pair.
